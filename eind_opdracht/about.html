          The Who are an English rock band that formed in 1964. Their classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist and singer Pete Townshend, bass guitarist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide and holding a reputation for their live shows and studio work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, <q>I Can't Explain</q>, reached the UK top ten, followed by a string of singles including <q>My Generation</q>, <q>Substitute</q> and <q>Happy Jack</q>. In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single <q>I Can See for Miles</q>, while touring extensively. The group's fourth album, 1969's rock opera <em>Tommy</em>, included the single <q>Pinball Wizard</q> and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival, along with the live album <em>Live at Leeds</em>, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend, and the follow-up to <em>Tommy</em>, <em>Lifehouse</em>, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971's <em>Who's Next</em>, which included the hit <q>Won't Get Fooled Again</q>. The group released the album <em>Quadrophenia</em> in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of <em>Tommy</em> in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of <em>Who Are You</em> in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed activity, releasing a film adaptation of <em>Quadrophenia</em> and the retrospective documentary <em>The Kids Are Alright</em>. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1982. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of <em>Quadrophenia</em> in 1996–1997. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing <em>Endless Wire</em> in 2006, and continued to play live regularly.
        </p>
        <h2>Musical style and equipment</h2>
        <p>
          The Who have been regarded primarily as a rock band, yet have taken influence from several other styles of music during their career. The original group played a mixture of trad jazz and contemporary pop hits as the Detours, and R&B in 1963. The group move to a mod sound the following year, particularly after hearing the Small Faces fuse Motown with a harsher R&B sound. The group's early work was geared towards singles, though it was not straightforward pop. In 1967, Townshend coined the term <q>power pop</q> to describe the Who's style. Like their contemporaries, the group were influenced by the arrival of Hendrix, particularly after the Who and the Experience met at Monterey. This and lengthy touring strengthened the band's sound. In the studio, they began to develop softer pieces, particularly from <em>Tommy</em> onwards, and turned their attention towards albums more than singles.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the early 1970s, the band's sound included synthesizers, particularly on <em>Who's Next</em> and <em>Quadrophenia</em>. Although groups had used synthesizers before, the Who were one of the first to integrate the sound into a basic rock structure. In <em>By Numbers</em> the group's style had scaled back to more standard rock, but synthesisers regained prominence on <em>Face Dances</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Townshend and Entwistle were instrumental in making extreme volumes and distortion standard rock practices. The Who were early adopters of Marshall Amplification. Entwistle was the first member to get two 4×12 speaker cabinets, quickly followed by Townshend. The group used feedback as part of their guitar sound, both live and in the studio. In 1967, Townshend changed to using Sound City amplifiers, customised by Dave Reeves, then in 1970 to Hiwatt. The group were the first to use a 1000 watt PA systems for live gigs, which led to competition from bands such as the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout their careers, the members of the Who have said their live sound has never been captured as they wished on record. Live gigs and the audience have always been important to the group. <q>Irish</q> Jack Lyons said, <q>The Who weren't a joke, they were fucking real, and so were we.</q>
        </p>
        <h2>Personal relationships</h2>
        <p>
          The Who are perceived as having had a poor working relationship. In the original band, Sandom had been the peacemaker and settled disputes. Moon, by contrast, was as volatile as Daltrey and Townshend. Entwistle was too passive to become involved in arguments. The group established their live reputation and stage show in part out of insecurity and aggression amongst its members and Townshend recalled that all decisions had to be made democratically <q>because we always disagreed</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only genuine friendship in the Who during the 1960s was between Entwistle and Moon. The pair enjoyed each other's sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing. Journalist Richard Green noted a <q>chemistry of playfullness that would go beyond playfullness</q>. Their relationship diminished somewhat when Entwistle got married in 1967, though they still socialised on tour. When Moon was destroying toilets in hotels, Entwistle confessed he <q>was standing behind him with the matches.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          The group regularly argued in the press, though Townshend said disputes were amplified in print and the group simply found it difficult to agree on things. <em>Tommy</em> mutually benefitted Townshend and Daltrey's standing in the band because of the former's songwriting and the latter's stage presence, yet even this did not make them close friends. The pair quarrelled, particularly in the mid-1970s, over the group's direction. During his time with the band, Jones was subject to intermittent criticism from Daltrey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entwistle's death came as a shock to both Townshend and Daltrey, and caused them to re-evaluate their relationship. Townshend has said that he and Daltrey have since become close friends. In 2015, Townshend confirmed their friendship was still strong, adding their acceptance of each other's differences <q>brought us to a really genuine and compassionate relationship, which can only be described as love.</q>
        </p>
        <h2>Legacy and influence</h2>
        <p>
          The Who are one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century. Their appearances at Monterey and Woodstock helped give them a reputation as one of the greatest live rock acts and they have been credited with originating the <q>rock opera</q>. The band has sold over 100 million records worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group's contributions to rock include the power chord, windmill strum and the use of non-musical instrument noise such as feedback. The band influenced fashion from their earliest days with their embrace of pop art and the use of the Union Jack for clothing. The guitar-smashing incident at the Railway Hotel in 1964 is one of Rolling Stone magazine's <q>50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock 'n' Roll</q>.
