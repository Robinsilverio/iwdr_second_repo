          Peter Dennis Blandford Townshend (born 19 May 1945) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, best known as the lead guitarist, backing vocalist, and principal songwriter for the rock band the Who. His career with the Who spans over 50 years, during which time the band grew to be considered one of the most influential bands of the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Townshend is the main songwriter for the Who, having written well over 100 songs for the band's 11 studio albums, including concept albums and the rock operas Tommy and Quadrophenia, plus popular rock radio staples such as Who's Next, and dozens more that appeared as non-album singles, bonus tracks on reissues, and tracks on rarities compilations such as <q>Odds & Sods</q> (1974). He has also written more than 100 songs that have appeared on his solo albums, as well as radio jingles and television theme songs. Although known primarily as a guitarist, he also plays keyboards, banjo, accordion, harmonica, ukulele, mandolin, violin, synthesiser, bass guitar, and drums, on his own solo albums, several Who albums and as a guest contributor to an array of other artists' recordings. He is self-taught on all of the instruments he plays and has never had any formal training.

        <h2>Musical career</h2>
        <h3>1964-1982 - The Who</h3>
        <p>
          Not long after the name change, drummer Doug Sandom was replaced by Keith Moon, who had been drumming semi-professionally with the Beachcombers for several years. The band was soon taken on by a mod publicist named Peter Meaden who convinced them to change their name to the High Numbers to give the band more of a mod feel. After bringing out one failed single (<q>I'm the Face/Zoot Suit</q>), they dropped Meaden and were signed on by two new managers, Chris Stamp and Kit Lambert, who had paired up with the intention of finding new talent and creating a documentary about them. The band anguished over a name that all felt represented the band best, and dropped the High Numbers name, reverting to the Who. In June 1964, during a performance at the Railway Tavern, Townshend accidentally broke the top of his guitar on the low ceiling and proceeded to destroy the entire instrument. The on-stage destruction of instruments soon became a regular part of the Who's live shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the assistance of Lambert, the Who caught the ear of American record producer Shel Talmy, who had the band signed to a record contract. Townshend wrote a song, <q>I Can't Explain</q>, as a deliberate sound-alike of the Kinks, another group Talmy produced. Released as a single in January 1965, <q>I Can't Explain</q> was the Who's first hit, reaching number eight on the British charts. A follow-up single (<q>Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere</q>), credited to both Townshend and Daltrey, also reached the top 10 in the UK. However, it was the release of the Who's third single, <q>My Generation</q>, in November that, according to Who biographer Mark Wilkerson, <q>cemented their reputation as a hard-nosed band who reflected the feelings of thousands of pissed-off adolescents at the time.</q> The Townshend-penned single reached number two on the UK charts, becoming the Who's biggest hit. The song and its famous line <q>I hope I die before I get old</q> was <q>very much about trying to find a place in society,</q> Townshend stated in an interview with David Fricke.
        </p>
        <p>
          To capitalise on their recent single success, the Who's debut album My Generation (The Who Sings My Generation in the US) was released in late 1965, containing original material written by Townshend and several James Brown covers that Daltrey favoured. Townshend continued to write several successful singles for the band, including <q>Pictures of Lily</q>, <q>Substitute</q>, <q>I'm a Boy</q>, and <q>I'm a Boy</q>. Lambert encouraged Townshend to write longer pieces of music for the next album, which became the <q>A Quick One, While He's Away</q>. The album was subsequently titled A Quick One and reached number 4 in the charts upon its release in December 1966. In their stage shows, Townshend developed a guitar stunt in which he would swing his right arm against the guitar strings in a style reminiscent of the vanes of a windmill. He developed this style after watching Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards warm up before a show.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Who commenced their first US tour on 22 March 1967. It did not start well, as Townshend and Daltrey were briefly jailed for assaulting a police officer they mistook for a heckler. Townshend took to trashing his hotel suites, though not to the extent of his bandmate Moon. He also began experimenting with LSD, though stopped taking the drug after receiving a potent hit after the Monterey Pop Festival on 18 June. Released in December, their next album was The Who Sell Out—a concept album based on pirate radio, which had been instrumental in raising the Who's popularity. It included several humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs, and the Who's biggest US single, <q>I Can See for Miles</q>. Despite the success of <q></q>, which reached number 9 on the American charts, Townshend was surprised it was not a smash hit, as he considered it the best song he'd written up to that point.
        </p>
        <h3>1972 - Present</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to his work with the Who, Townshend has been sporadically active as a solo recording artist. Between 1969 and 1971 Townshend, along with other devotees to Meher Baba, recorded a trio of albums devoted to his teachings: Happy Birthday, I Am, and With Love. In response to bootlegging of these, he compiled his personal highlights (and <q>Evolution</q>, a collaboration with Ronnie Lane), and released his first major-label solo title, 1972's Who Came First. It was a moderate success and featured demos of Who songs as well as a showcase of his acoustic guitar talents. He collaborated with The Faces' bassist and fellow Meher Baba devotee Ronnie Lane on a duet album (1977's Rough Mix). Townshend's solo breakthrough, following the death of Who drummer Keith Moon, was the 1980 release Empty Glass, which included a top-10 single, <q>Let My Love Open the Door</q> and <q>Rough Boys</q>. This release was followed in 1982 by All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes, which included the popular radio track <q>Slit Skirts</q>. While not a huge commercial success, noted music critic Timothy Duggan listed it as <q>Townshend's most honest and introspective work since Quadrophenia.</q> Through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s Townshend would again experiment with the rock opera and related formats, releasing several story-based albums including White City: A Novel (1985), The Iron Man: A Musical (1989), and Psychoderelict (1993). Townshend also got the chance to play with his hero Hank Marvin for Paul McCartney's <q>Rockestra</q> sessions, along with other respected rock musicians such as David Gilmour, John Bonham and Ronnie Lane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Townshend has also recorded several concert albums, including one featuring a supergroup he assembled called Deep End, who performed just three concerts and a television show session for The Tube, to raise money for a charity supporting drug addicts. In 1993 he and Des McAnuff wrote and directed the Broadway adaptation of the Who album Tommy, as well as a less successful stage musical based on his solo album The Iron Man, based upon the book by Ted Hughes. McAnuff and Townshend later co-produced the animated film The Iron Giant, also based on the Hughes story.

          A production described as a Townshend rock opera and titled The Boy Who Heard Music debuted as part of Vassar College's Powerhouse Summer Theater program in July 2007.

          On 2 September 2017 in Lenox, Massachusetts, Pete Townshend embarked with fellow singer and musician Billy Idol, tenor Alfie Boeon and an orchestra on a short (5-date) <q>Classic Quadrophenia</q> US tour which ended on 16 September 2017 in Los Angeles, California.
        </p>
        <h3>1996-present: Last Who work</h3>
        <p>
          From the mid-1990s through the present, Townshend has participated in a series of tours with the surviving members of the Who, including a 2002 tour that continued despite Entwistle's death.
        </p>

        <p>
          In February 2006, a major world tour by the Who was announced to promote their first new album since 1982. Townshend published a semi-autobiographical story The Boy Who Heard Music as a serial on a blog beginning in September 2005. The blog closed in October 2006, as noted on Townshend's website. It is now owned by a different user and does not relate to Townshend's work in any way. On 25 February 2006, he announced the issue of a mini-opera inspired by the novella for June 2006. In October 2006 the Who released their first album in 26 years, Endless Wire.

        <p>
          The Who performed at the Super Bowl XLIV half-time show on 7 February 2010, playing a medley of songs that included <q>Pinball Wizard</q>, <q>Who Are You</q>, <q>Baba O'Riley</q>, <q>See Me Feel Me</q> and <q>Won't Get Fooled Again</q>. In 2012, the Who announced they would tour the rock opera Quadrophenia.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Who were the final performers at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London, performing a medley of <q>Baba O'Riley</q>, <q>See Me, Feel Me</q> and <q>My Generation</q>.
