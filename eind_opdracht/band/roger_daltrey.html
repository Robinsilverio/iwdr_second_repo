         Roger Harry Daltrey, <abbr title="Commander of the Order of the British Empire">CBE</abbr> (born 1 March 1944) is an English singer and actor. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Daltrey came to prominence in the mid-1960s as the founder and lead singer of the rock band the Who, which released 14 singles that entered the Top 10 charts in the United Kingdom during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including <q>I Can't Explain</q>, <q>My Generation</q>, <q>Substitute</q>, <q>I'm a Boy</q>, <q>Happy Jack</q>, <q>Pictures of Lil</q>, <q>Pinball Wizard</q>, <q>Won't Get Fooled Again</q>, and <q>You Better You Bet</q>. Daltrey began his solo career in 1973, while still a member of the Who. Since then, he has released eight studio albums, five compilation albums, and one live album. His solo hits include <q>Giving It All Away</q>, <q>Walking the Dog</q>, <q>Written on the Wind</q>, <q>Free Me</q>, <q>Without Your Love</q>, <q>Walking in My Sleep</q>, <q>After the Fire</q>, and <q>Under a Raging Moon</q>. In 2010, he was ranked as number 61 on <em>Rolling Stone</em>'s list of the 100 greatest singers of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daltrey has been known as one of the most charismatic of rock's frontmen and famed for his powerful voice and energetic stage presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member of the Who, Daltrey received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988, and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> Music Hall of Fame in 2005. The Who are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide. He and Pete Townshend received Kennedy Center Honors in 2008 and The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at <abbr title="University of California, Los Angeles">UCLA</abbr> on 21 May 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daltrey has also been an actor and film producer, with roles in films, theatre, and television.
        </p>
        <h2>Career with The Who</h2>
        <p>
          With the band's first hit single (<q>I Can't Explain</q>) and record deal in early 1965, Townshend began writing original material and Daltrey's dominance of the band began to decrease.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other members of the Who expelled Daltrey from the band in late 1965 after he beat up their drummer Keith Moon for supplying illegal drugs to Townshend and Entwistle, causing him to re-examine his methods of dealing with people. A week later, Daltrey was admitted back to the band, but was told he'd be on probation. He promised that there would be no more violent outbursts or assaults. Daltrey recalled, <q>I thought if I lost the band I was dead. If I didn't stick with the Who, I would be a sheet metal worker for the rest of my life.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          The band's second single, <q>Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere</q>, was the only song on which Daltrey and Townshend collaborated, and Daltrey wrote only two other songs for the band during these years. As Townshend developed into one of rock's most accomplished composers, Daltrey's vocals became the vehicle through which Townshend's visions were expressed, and he gained an equally vaunted reputation as a powerful singer and riveting front-man. The Who's stage act was highly energetic, and Daltrey's habit of swinging the microphone around by its cord on stage became his signature move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daltrey's Townshend-inspired stuttering expression of youthful anger, frustration, and arrogance in the band's breakthrough single, <q>My Generation</q>, captured the revolutionary feeling of the 1960s for many young people around the world and became the band's trademark. Later, his scream near the end of <q>Won't Get Fooled Again</q> became a defining moment in rock and roll.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 1973, Daltrey was experiencing considerable success with his solo projects and acting roles. While other members of the band worked on recording the music for <em>Quadrophenia</em>, Daltrey used some of this time to check the Who's books. He found they had fallen into disarray under the management of Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. Lambert was also Pete Townshend's artistic mentor, and challenging him led to renewed tension within the band. During a filming session (in an incident that Daltrey claimed was overblown) Townshend and Daltrey argued over the schedule. Townshend hit Daltrey over the head with his guitar, and Daltrey responded by knocking Townshend unconscious, again with a single blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Who continued after the death of their drummer Keith Moon in 1978, but tension continued to rise as Daltrey felt that new drummer Kenney Jones was the wrong choice for the Who. In 1980, Daltrey completed a drama film called <em>McVicar</em> about British bank robber John McVicar. Daltrey produced and starred in the film, and completed a soundtrack with other members of the band. This success, along with other stresses, contributed to a deterioration of relations with Townshend, and the Who retired from active touring in 1982 when Townshend felt that he was no longer able to write for the band. The band continued to work together sporadically, reuniting for the Live Aid concert, and recording songs for Daltrey's solo album <em>Under a Raging Moon</em>, and Townshend's solo album <em>The Iron Man: The Musical by Pete Townshend</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daltrey turned to working as an actor, with roles in projects such as <em>The Beggar's Opera</em> and <em>The Comedy of Errors</em> for the BBC. He appeared in several film, television, and stage productions during this period, including Mike Batt's <em>The Hunting of the Snark</em> (1987), <em>The Little Match Girl</em> (1987), <em>Buddy's Song</em> (1992), which he also produced, and <em>Mack the Knife</em> (1990). In 1991, he received a Grammy Award with the Chieftains for <em>An Irish Evening: Live at the Grand Opera House, Belfast</em>. In 1993 Daltrey starred in an episode of Tales From The Crypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Who returned in 1989 with their 25th Anniversary Tour, which was also the 20th anniversary of their rock opera <em>Tommy</em>. The tour featured a large backing band, and guest appearances by Steve Winwood, Patti LaBelle, Phil Collins, Elton John, and Billy Idol. In spite of an abdominal hemangioma (later removed by surgery), Daltrey managed to complete the tour. He continued to work on stage and screen, completing projects such as <em>The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True</em> (1995) appearing as the Tin Woodman alongside Nathan Lane, Joel Grey, Natalie Cole, and Jewel as Dorothy. During this time, he also began to appear in US television shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1994, Daltrey celebrated his 50th birthday by performing a two-night spectacular at Carnegie Hall titled <em>A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who</em>, which is popularly also known as <em>Daltrey Sings Townshend</em>. The Who's music was arranged for orchestra by Michael Kamen, who conducted the Juilliard Orchestra for the event. Bob Ezrin, who produced Pink Floyd's <em>The Wall</em> album, among other famous albums, produced the live album. Pete Townshend, John Entwistle, Eddie Vedder (who performed a special acoustic tribute), Sinéad O'Connor, Lou Reed, David Sanborn, Alice Cooper, Linda Perry, the Chieftains, and others performed as special guests. Michael Lindsay-Hogg directed the telecast, which was aired on satellite TV. The concert, at the time, was the fastest sell-out in the famed venue's history. The event was co-produced by Richard Flanzer, his manager at the time. The event was followed by a major tour financed by Daltrey and including John Entwistle on bass, Zak Starkey on drums, and Simon Townshend on guitar. Although the tour was considered an artistic success, it failed to make any profit due to the expense of providing extraordinary musicians and orchestras in every city to replicate the Carnegie Hall event. Significantly, the tour did attract attention to songs from the Who's rock opera <em>Quadrophenia</em> and gathered support for a staging and major tour of the rock opera in 1996–97.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1996, Pete Townshend was approached to produce <em>Quadrophenia</em> for the Prince's Trust concert at Hyde Park, London. He at first planned to perform the opera as a solo acoustic piece using parts of the film on the screens, but after receiving offers of financing decided on a full-out production. When he first contacted Daltrey to request a collaboration, Daltrey refused, but after some discussion, he agreed to help produce a one-off performance. The opera was performed with a large backing band, including John Entwistle on bass, Pete Townshend on acoustic guitar, and vocals, Zak Starkey on drums, John <q>Rabbit</q> Bundrick, and Jon Carin on keyboards, Simon Townshend on guitar, and special guests including David Gilmour, Ade Edmondson, Trevor McDonald, and Gary Glitter. A horn section and backing vocalists were added, along with other actors. On the night before the show, Daltrey was struck in the face by a microphone stand swung by Gary Glitter. The accident fractured his eye socket and caused considerable concern that he might not be able to perform safely, but Daltrey donned an eye-patch to cover the bruises and completed the show as scheduled. Afterward, Townshend decided to take the production on tour in 1996–97 as the Who.
        </p>
        <p>
          After their <em>Quadrophenia</em> tour was successful, the band returned as the Who in a stripped-down, five-piece line-up for tours in 1999–2000. The band continued to work together, making a major impact at the Concert for New York City. After Entwistle's death in June 2002, both Daltrey and Townshend decided to continue with an already planned tour as the Who. Bass player Pino Palladino was chosen to fill Entwistle's place. The band also completed a brief tour in 2004. In 2006, they released their first studio album of new material in twenty-four years, <q>Endless Wire</q>, leading some fans and critics to say that the highly acclaimed artistic tension within the Who lay between the two principals Daltrey and Townshend. The band completed a world tour in 2006–07 to support this album.

          In February 2010, Townshend and Daltrey, headlining as the Who, performed the half-time show at Super Bowl XLIV in front of 105.97 million viewers across the globe. In March 2010, Townshend and Daltrey, along with an extensive backing band, performed <em>Quadrophenia</em> at the Royal Albert Hall in London as a tenth anniversary charity benefit for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam sang the part of the Godfather, and Tom Meighan of Kasabian sang the part of Aceface, and Tom Norris, London Symphony Orchestra Co-Principal Second Violin, played violin for the production.
