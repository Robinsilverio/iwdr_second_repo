          Roger Harry Daltrey, <abbr title="Commander of the Order of the British Empire">CBE</abbr> (born 1 March 1944) is an English singer and actor. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Daltrey came to prominence in the mid-1960s as the founder and lead singer of the rock band the Who, which released 14 singles that entered the Top 10 charts in the United Kingdom during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including <q>I Can't Explain</q>, <q>My Generation</q>, <q>Substitute</q>, <q>I'm a Boy</q>, <q>Happy Jack</q>, <q>Pictures of Lil</q>, <q>Pinball Wizard</q>, <q>Won't Get Fooled Again</q>, and <q>You Better You Bet</q>. Daltrey began his solo career in 1973, while still a member of the Who. Since then, he has released eight studio albums, five compilation albums, and one live album. His solo hits include <q>Giving It All Away</q>, <q>Walking the Dog</q>, <q>Written on the Wind</q>, <q>Free Me</q>, <q>Without Your Love</q>, <q>Walking in My Sleep</q>, <q>After the Fire</q>, and <q>Under a Raging Moon</q>. In 2010, he was ranked as number 61 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 greatest singers of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daltrey has been known as one of the most charismatic of rock's frontmen and famed for his powerful voice and energetic stage presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member of the Who, Daltrey received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Phonographic Industry in 1988, and from the Grammy Foundation in 2001. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. The Who are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over 100 million records worldwide. He and Pete Townshend received Kennedy Center Honors in 2008 and The George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at UCLA on 21 May 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daltrey has also been an actor and film producer, with roles in films, theatre, and television.
        </p>
        <h2>Career with the Who</h2>
        <p>
          With the band's first hit single (<q>I Can't Explain</q>) and record deal in early 1965, Townshend began writing original material and Daltrey's dominance of the band began to decrease.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other members of the Who expelled Daltrey from the band in late 1965 after he beat up their drummer Keith Moon for supplying illegal drugs to Townshend and Entwistle, causing him to re-examine his methods of dealing with people. A week later, Daltrey was admitted back to the band, but was told he'd be on probation. He promised that there would be no more violent outbursts or assaults. Daltrey recalled, <q>I thought if I lost the band I was dead. If I didn't stick with the Who, I would be a sheet metal worker for the rest of my life.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
          The band's second single, <q>Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere</q>, was the only song on which Daltrey and Townshend collaborated, and Daltrey wrote only two other songs for the band during these years. As Townshend developed into one of rock's most accomplished composers, Daltrey's vocals became the vehicle through which Townshend's visions were expressed, and he gained an equally vaunted reputation as a powerful singer and riveting front-man. The Who's stage act was highly energetic, and Daltrey's habit of swinging the microphone around by its cord on stage became his signature move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daltrey's Townshend-inspired stuttering expression of youthful anger, frustration, and arrogance in the band's breakthrough single, <q>My Generation</q>, captured the revolutionary feeling of the 1960s for many young people around the world and became the band's trademark. Later, his scream near the end of <q>Won't Get Fooled Again</q> became a defining moment in rock and roll.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 1973, Daltrey was experiencing considerable success with his solo projects and acting roles. While other members of the band worked on recording the music for Quadrophenia, Daltrey used some of this time to check the Who's books. He found they had fallen into disarray under the management of Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. Lambert was also Pete Townshend's artistic mentor, and challenging him led to renewed tension within the band. During a filming session (in an incident that Daltrey claimed was overblown) Townshend and Daltrey argued over the schedule. Townshend hit Daltrey over the head with his guitar, and Daltrey responded by knocking Townshend unconscious, again with a single blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Who continued after the death of their drummer Keith Moon in 1978, but tension continued to rise as Daltrey felt that new drummer Kenney Jones was the wrong choice for the Who.[20] In 1980, Daltrey completed a drama film called McVicar about British bank robber John McVicar. Daltrey produced and starred in the film, and completed a soundtrack with other members of the band. This success, along with other stresses, contributed to a deterioration of relations with Townshend, and the Who retired from active touring in 1982 when Townshend felt that he was no longer able to write for the band.[21] The band continued to work together sporadically, reuniting for the Live Aid concert, and recording songs for Daltrey's solo album Under a Raging Moon, and Townshend's solo album The Iron Man: The Musical by Pete Townshend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daltrey turned to working as an actor, with roles in projects such as The Beggar's Opera and The Comedy of Errors for the BBC. He appeared in several film, television, and stage productions during this period, including Mike Batt's The Hunting of the Snark (1987), The Little Match Girl (1987), Buddy's Song (1992), which he also produced, and Mack the Knife (1990). In 1991, he received a Grammy Award with the Chieftains for An Irish Evening: Live at the Grand Opera House, Belfast. In 1993 Daltrey starred in an episode of Tales From The Crypt.

          The Who returned in 1989 with their 25th Anniversary Tour, which was also the 20th anniversary of their rock opera Tommy. The tour featured a large backing band, and guest appearances by Steve Winwood, Patti LaBelle, Phil Collins, Elton John, and Billy Idol. In spite of an abdominal hemangioma (later removed by surgery), Daltrey managed to complete the tour. He continued to work on stage and screen, completing projects such as The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True (1995) appearing as the Tin Woodman alongside Nathan Lane, Joel Grey, Natalie Cole, and Jewel as Dorothy. During this time, he also began to appear in US television shows.
