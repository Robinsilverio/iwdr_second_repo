          Like many of their contemporaries, the Who adapted to the constantly evolving '60s music scene by expanding their scope and sound. They just did it better than almost everyone else. They started off combining Pete Townshend's guitar-powered teen-angst anthems with covers of American soul songs, which they somehow managed to turn into guitar-powered teen-angst anthems. As Townshend, John Entwistle and Keith Moon tightened their instrumental interplay, and Roger Daltrey became one of rock's most powerhouse singers, it gave Townshend the confidence to undertake even more ambitious projects, like the rock operas 'Tommy' and 'Quadrophenia' and the career-defining 'Who's Next.' Our list of the Top 10 Who Songs covers the best of the original quartet.
